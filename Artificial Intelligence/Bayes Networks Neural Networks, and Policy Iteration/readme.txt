For this project, I write a program that does inference in a (non-polytree) Bayesian network using the Monte Carlo method. The input file is similar to (but not exactly the same as) the input file for message propagation

The first line of the input file will be the number of variables in the system. 
The next n lines of the input file (one for each variable in the system) will contain the variables in the system
